This is a template for setting up an app in a Python virtualenv.

After cloning, add your python venv to the `./venv` directory,
activate it, and run:

```bash
./bin/python.sh -m pip install --upgrade pip
./bin/python.sh -m pip install -r requirements.pip
```

When using this framework, always run python via `python.sh` in the
`./bin` directory - this will set the proper environment variables
for IPython use and for importing packages from `./app-packages`.

You can override environment variables set in `./config/env_defaults.sh`
by creating a `./config/env_local.sh` file - this file will not be
tracked by Git.

Best practice for running IPython Qtconsole is thusly:
```
./bin/python.sh -m jupyter qtconsole &
```

You can also get easier access to programs in `./bin` by running:
```
source ./config/env_defaults.sh
```

which will prepend `./bin` to the PATH environment variable.
