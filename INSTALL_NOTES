Before installing Mayavi, it's usually best to pip install numpy, vtk, and pyqt5
first.

I had Mayavi working fine in a Python 3.11 venv. At some point, I had to do a
`sudo apt install python3.11-dev` to get the Python headers required to `pip
install` the `transformations` Python module. Later, when I tried to re-create
the venv from scratch, Mayavi would no longer build. Turns out that this time,
it was trying to use the headers from `python3.11-dev`, and there were errors
in the way Mayavi did that.  So I had to `sudo apt remove --purge
python3.11-dev`, then `sudo apt autoremove` to get rid of some shared Python
libraries. After that, all was well again.
